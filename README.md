# Taxi-company-management-system
This is a taxi management project. 这是一个出租车公司管理系统的C++小组作业。

管理员账号和密码都是：admin
功能自己探索吧，输入上面将所有的cin>>替换为自己定义的输入函数，避免了所有输入引起的bug。

The account number of the administrator is ‘admin’ and the password is ‘admin’.

	Administrator login:
1.	The administrator can view all taxi information. This includes driver information and vehicle information.
2.	Each taxi contains one or two drivers. When adding a driver, driver 1 must be input, and driver 2 can press enter directly to choose not to input.
3.	Each taxi should be assigned a unique car ID. If taxis with the same car ID are added repeatedly, the addition will fail.
4.	The administrator can delete, add, query and edit the taxi information.
	Driver login:
1.	After getting the car ID and password set by the administrator, the driver can log in to his own service system.
2.	Drivers can view their personal information and reward and punishment records.
3.	After starting the service, passengers should be asked to pay and evaluate the service (used to record reward and punishment information).
